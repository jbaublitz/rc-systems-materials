# Assignment #1: Become more familiar with C pointers and structs
This assignment is meant to introduce you to some fundamental concepts around the semantics of the programming language C.
In this assignment you'll be asked to update source code to print a series of outputs to the terminal. This involves
understanding structs and pointers.

## Part 1 - Print the proper output:

### Skeleton code
The code to work off of is in the directory `1-assignment-code/`

### Testing
To run the tests on your code, run `make` in the directory `1-assignment-code`

### Build and run your code
To run your code without tests, run this in the terminal
```
$ make builld
$ ./1-print
```
It should print out 5 numbers:
```
1
5
7
2
4
```

### Instructions
All of the details instructions are added as comments in the code.

Read through all of it and try to understand how this works on a high level before diving in.
